* What is this project about?
** Problem set definition
It is about solving the common task of alternating contents of UI components
based on user actions and URL navigation.

For example:

It is very common for toolbars to contain multiple buttons. Some of these
buttons may change the contents of the toolbar among producing other side
effects.

Such a feature would be categorized as a 'user action' of the problem set
definition.

At the same time, one would also like that same toolbar to be aware of the
URL location under which it is being rendered and have it behave accordingly.

Such a feature would be categorized as a 'URL navigation' section of the problem
set definition.
